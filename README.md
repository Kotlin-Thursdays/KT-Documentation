# Kotlin Thursdays Documentation
To better streamline the ability for others to contribute new content to Kotlin Thursdays, the Kotlin Thursdays team wrote up some guidelines and tips for making submissions! Don't hesitate to reach out to admins and we'll help you along every step of the way from start to Kotlin Thursday!

## So you want to write up a tutorial?
Whether it's a single tutorial or multiple parts,
**Challenges:**
 - SCOPE:  Scope is the hardest part, you'll want to keep it at a max of 45 minutes. You'll want to design an outline to create small intermissions for viewers and to help explain the progress of the project or topic
- Required technology: we have some recommendations on the minimum you'll need to accomplish recordings yourself without paying for anything, but feel free to reach out for recommendations based on what OS you use and other constraints might be involved

## 1. Complete the project or code you'd like to stream about.
As you complete your project, be sure to write notes on the side as much as you can from struggles you might have encountered yourself, neat tricks you've learned, why you have preferences for some technologies, and your overall experience learning or completing your project.  We host our projects on Github, where you'll welcome to reach out to us to become a member and contribute a new repository.

Every repository will follow a naming convention for organizational purposes, but every repository must include a general readme which will eventually need to be linked (preferably, the day before the Kotlin Thursday is released).

For the time being, feel free to use the readme located under [filename link in github] for COMING SOON! as you progress on your project.

## 2. Write up a blog post.
Whether it's a single tutorial or multiple parts, you'll need to write a blog for a couple reasons:
1. Increased accessibility for learners and readers
2. It will help you direct your narration of the project and keep the flow for your recording!
Be sure to start from the very beginning.  The intention of Kotlin Thursdays is to make no assumption the user is familiar with any particular library or IDE or framework.

## 3. Send it to Kotlin Thursday admins for review!
We just want to make sure you're not feeding lies to the audience.  Joking.  We want to make sure the format is followed and make sure there aren't missing gaps or typos. Before sending, make sure you've checked for errors yourself.

## 4. Record an episode!
We need separate videos that we can weave together, including our animated opening for Kotlin Thursdays.  You're welcome to use methods that work best for you, whether you screencast coding with QuickTime record screen and you wish to create an overlay of audio, or you can use [OBS Project](https://obsproject.com/), an open-source technology that is free to download and helps you switch between views, simulataneously record, etc. 

### Introduction/Overview:
 - **Record a video of yourself introducing yourself and the topic you'd like to cover.** This makes the learning experience more personable and we'd love to see who you are!

 - **Talk about the motivations - what is the problem and why do we care?** How do we solve the problem?  This may not mean coding, this could be more of a whiteboard/discussion.  If you have chicken scratch like I do, we have an animator for graphics surrounding things like general architecture patterns, algorithms, data structures, etc. This portion is free-form and we'll consider your needs on a case-by-case basis.

### Screencast your coding session:
- **Use your blog and your completed as a guideline to create a smooth live-coding session.** You can decide based on what you have available to you whether you'd like to record the screencasting with narrating simultaenously or if you'd like to complete a voiceover in addition to the screencast itself.  
- **If a video is longer than 7 minutes, create an outline for intervals that will help summarize and wrap up the work you're doing to help the audience understand the high-level of the components required to accomplish your problem-solving/goal.**  You'll want to include recordings on yourself as you create these intervals to help tie together segments.

### Recording Guidelines
- Be sure to record in a small room where there isn't a lot of background noise going on
- Use headphones to isolate sound and guaruantee better quality sound
- Stay hydrated, and be aware of the noises your body makes on recording and be aware of them to minimize it. (i.e. lip smacking, coughing, etc). 
- While not required, if you have a microphone, cover it with some cloth to help soften those "Ps" and "S" that might come across harshly on audio.

## 5. Send us your recordings!
We'll put it together for you and send you the product for your "GO" on releasing!
